Task 1
	"A free variable is a variable used within a function, which is neither a formal parameter to the function nor defined in the function's body (and in scope at the point of the variable's use)." - c2
	It thusly doesn't make any sense for a), b), and d) to talk about free or bound variables because they're not functions.
	Even if we assumed these were function bodies we simply can not see the function signature and infer which variables are parameters to this body.
	a) -
	b) -
	c) E and C are free variables, B and A are bound.
	d) -

Task 2
	a) E C U
	b) E
	c) /
	d) E U
	e) E

Task 3
	a)
		Append = proc {$ As Bs ?Out}
			case As of nil then
				Out = Bs
			else
				case As of '|'(A Ar) then
					local X in
						{Append Ar Bs X}
						Out = '|'(A X)
					end
				end
			end
		end

	b)
		Max = proc {$ X Y ?Out}
			if X==0 then
				Out = Y
			else
				if Y==0 then
					Out = X
				else
					Out = 1+{Max X-1 Y-1}
				end
			end
		end

Task 4
	<s> ::= local <x> ... <x_n> in <s> end

Task 5
	a) SAS: B - SS: [ if B | [ skip | skip ] ] => ?
	b) SAS: B = false - SS: [ if | [ skip | skip ] ] => [ skip ]
	c) SAS: X = 4 Z = 7 P = proc {$ X Y} Y = X + Z end

Task 6
	a) Fails - Due to a rebinding that basically states 2 = 3, which is false.
	b) Succeeds - A = a, B = a, C = a
	c) Succeeds - When A = 3|4|B|nil, [1 2 3 4 B]
	d) Succeeds - B = nil and A = 2, only then, [1 2 nil 3 4]
	e) Fails - due to a recursive definition
